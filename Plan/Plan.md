## 1. Goal

Implementing a model for End-To-End Argument Mining that fits into Axel Almqusit (phd student at CLASP) resarch of creating a resource for Argument Mining.

## 2. Project Details

The student will implement the LSTM-ER introduced in [1])(1) to solve End-To-End Argument Mining. The challanges will consist of understanding the relevant litterature, implementing and adding documentation and fitting the model into the existing Argument Mining framework created by Axel Almquist. ŸêAn additional optional task is to replicate the study presented in the original paper.

## 3. Schedule

The project is segemented into five major steps:

1. Survey the tree LSTM
2. Outline of model implementation
3. Model Implementation
4. Experiments
5. Result Analysis

Refer to the appendix A for the time schedule.
